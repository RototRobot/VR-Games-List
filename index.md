## Welcome to u/Robot_ninja_pirate's Page of Good VR games

# This is A WIP

Originally based on my [Google excel spread sheet of the same concept](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cnu3R813-RiJv9EPJD54qC7vBCrbh9xALIqz7hl5K-o/edit?usp=sharing)

The idea of this is to catagorize decent VR games that I have come accross to share and recommend to others

Q: Why should I listen to you?

A: IDK really I just play a lot of VR games but I'm no one special.

Q: why arent there more AAA games?

A: Triple A games are expensive to make and the VR market is small you might need to accept that and start looking at more indie and AA games

## Essential games

---

(before anything else you should really already own the following games)

[![Half-Life: Alyx](https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/546560/header.jpg?t=1635876995)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/546560/HalfLife_Alyx/)
[![Pavlov VR](https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/555160/header.jpg?t=1632855088)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/555160/Pavlov_VR/)
- Seriously if you don't own Alyx yet, then you have not even scractched the surface for good VR games 


[![Beat Saber](https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/620980/header.jpg)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/620980/Beat_Saber/)

- Warning Facebook bought the Beat Saber Devs in 2019 while I think its still the best VR Rythem game on the market It may give people pause if they are wanting to avoid Facebook (I will recommend some alternatives later)

- Warning in July 2021 the Devs Self Censored and removed a small bit of conent from the game

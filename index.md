## Welcome to u/Robot_ninja_pirate's Page of Good VR games

Originally based on my [Google excel spread sheet of the same concept](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cnu3R813-RiJv9EPJD54qC7vBCrbh9xALIqz7hl5K-o/edit?usp=sharing)

The idea of this is to catagorize decent VR games that I have come accross to share and recommend to others

Q: Why should I listen to you?

A: IDK really I just play a lot of VR games but I'm no one special.

Q: why arent there more AAA games?

A: Triple A games are expensive to make and the VR market is small you might need to accept that and start looking at more indie and AA games

### Essential games]

(before anything else you should really already own the following games)

[![Half-Life: Alyx](https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/546560/header.jpg?t=1635876995)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/546560/HalfLife_Alyx/)

- Seriously if you don't own Alyx yet, then you have not even scractched the surface for good VR games
